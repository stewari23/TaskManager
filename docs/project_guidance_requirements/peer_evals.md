# Group Project: Peer Evaluations and Your Final Individual Grade

## Project Grade

Peer Evaluations have a **direct correlation** to your final **individual** group project grade.

- Peer Evaluations will be used to determine the final project grade for each individual.
  - P1 and P2 Peer evaluations can receive up to 30 points each.
    - Example: You average a 3.5 out of 5 from your P1 evaluation. This means you would receive 21 of a possible 30 points
  - The final Peer Evaluations (P3) can recive up to 40 points.
- A total of 100 points can be awarded for all your Peer Evaluations (P1,P2 and P3).
- Total Points from evaluations will be used as the multiplier of how much of the final Group Project grade you receive.

### Here are some examples

**Group Grade: 100**;  Your Peer Total Grade: 75.  Then Your Project Grade will be 75%

**Group Grade: 80**; Peer Total Grade: 100. Then Your Project Grade will be 80%.

**Group Grade 80**; Peer Total Grade: 50%. Then Your Project Grade will be 40%.

## Sandbagging

When a student gives a maximum rating without providing comments or feedback, rather than actually evaluating their peer, it is often referred to as **"sandbagging"**. However, there are a few more common terms and scenarios related to this:

- **Halo Effect:** This is a cognitive bias where one's overall impression of a person influences how they feel about their character. In the context of peer reviews, if a student generally likes a peer or thinks highly of them, they might rate them positively across all categories without specific evaluation.

- **Grade Inflation:** While this term more commonly refers to educators giving higher grades than students deserve, it can be applied to peer evaluations. When students consistently give each other higher scores than deserved, it can dilute the value of the grading system.

- **Lack of Engagement:** Simply put, the student might not be taking the peer evaluation process seriously, opting for the easiest and quickest route to completion rather than offering meaningful feedback.

Some team members may "sandbag" their evaluations or one of the other common terms above. In academic settings, this behavior can be problematic as it doesn't provide accurate or useful feedback for the evaluated peer or instructor using the evaluation, and it doesn't encourage the evaluator to engage critically with their peers' work.

## Instructor Remediation Measures for Peer Evaluations

CSC 256 will try to counteract this tendency by making the commentary portion mandatory and by ensuring that the evaluation process itself contributes to the evaluator's assignment grade.

### Productive and Specific Comments

The Peer Evaluation Submittal will be graded on the quality of the evaluation for each criteria and each respective points.  For example if there is no feedback,  or a severe lack of productive feedback then your peer evaluation assignment grade will reflect that.  

**NOTE: **Resubmittal May Be Allowed**: If you provided a cursory or insufficient review, and want to improve your grade,  you can revise and resubmit as long as submitted BEFORE next peer review due.  

### Supporting Comments

- **Justification for ratings of 4 and 5 is required.**  If useful feedback and comments supporting a 4 or 5 are not provided the evaluation may be considered "sandbagging" causing a possible reduction in rating or the evaluation may be deemed as mute and not used in peer evaluation data collection.  No additional remediation will be done for a 3 or under (the reviewer may still get a poor assignment grade without comments).

## Group Participation

- The Instructor or team members cannot directly control the participation of other members in an academic environment which means the quality of the final project submission may suffer.

- This is why collaboration on both Teams and GitHub is critical.  The instructor can use these as observation input for final grades.  They aid in determining when one is really trying to accomplish the project.

  - For example, the student who is trying will also strive to do the best they can do with what they have and continue collaborating with their peers and instructor keeping them informed on their progress and what they are doing (Teams, Updating Issues, Reviewing Pull Requests, meeting their assignment group tasks on time etc)

If the project suffers from poor group participation and collaboration (more than 2 members) then the instructor has the option of awarding additional grade points to those who do due diligence and continue with the project and get as much completed as possible. There is a built in buffer in your group numbers. A competent group of 3 would be able to complete the project.

If the project suffers from poor lead management there are still many parts of the project that one can undertake.  This is why it is critical to document using the Issues and Project Milestones in GitHub. In addition, it is important to create Pull Requests and update the  Repository.  The instructor can use these as observation inputs for final grades.  This is a good way to keep track of what you are doing and have chosen to undertake.  The instructor has the option of awarding project lead points to those who do due diligence and continue with the project and get as much completed as possible.

**Final Total Points.**  The instructor will have discretion on final total points for both the peer evaluations and the final group project grade.

- Both Teams and your GitHub Repository will be reviewed and observed. If things are slowing down or issues are happening I expect to see them in Issues and well as Product and Sprint Backlogs.

- There will also be a scheduled Instructor Review after Sprint 1 and 3.  In this review your group will present your repository, issues and project status.

EXAMPLE: Group Grade 50%;  Peer Total Grade: 100%.  Then your project grade would be 50% but this is a case where the instructor will further delve into what happened and may award more points.

### What Can You Do?

Here is an example:

EXAMPLE: You and maybe one other are really trying to make the project work but you are getting poor support.

FIRST: You must document this in your Peer Reviews where individual peer participation can be evaluated

SECOND: Document in GitHub Issues and your respective Teams channel.  Only address the issues not the person.

THIRD:  Continue to  strive to do the best you can do can do with what you have.  Here are some examples of issues.

- Issue:  You are working on the Selenium lab but the testers are not providing feedback or that you are having to do your own test without support which is taking more time.

- If someone was assigned the API Documentation but did not follow thru.  You reshuffle to fix the hole and you try to do it as best as you can, and note this in the issues.

FORTH: Continue collaborating with your peers keeping them informed on your progress and what you are doing (Teams and GitHub).
