# Educational Lab Plan for Task Manager Application

## 1. Introduction

**Objective:** The educational labs are designed to teach students how to effectively use various testing tools to validate and ensure the quality of the Task Management System (TMS) project. These labs will cover writing, executing, and analyzing tests using Pytest, Selenium, Playwright, and Robot Framework.

**Scope:** This plan outlines the requirements and approach for developing educational labs that align with the testing tools and strategies used in the TMS project.

## 2. Lab Structure and Requirements

**Tools and Technologies:**

- **Pytest:** For unit testing individual components and functions.
- **Selenium:** For automating UI testing and verifying user interactions.
- **Playwright:** For end-to-end testing, covering the full user journey.
- **Robot Framework:** For acceptance testing, ensuring that the application meets user requirements.

**Pre-requisites:**

- Python 3.x installed.
- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
- Familiarity with web applications and basic testing concepts.
- Browser drivers configured for Selenium and Playwright.

**Expected Outcomes:**

- Students will gain practical experience with each testing tool.
- Ability to write, execute, and interpret test results.
- Understanding of how different types of tests contribute to software quality.

## 3. Lab Schedule and Timeline

**Timeline:**

- **Week 11-12:** Complete the Pytest lab.
- **Week 12-13:** Complete the Selenium lab.
- **Week 13-14:** Complete the Playwright lab.
- **Week 14-15:** Complete the Robot Framework lab.

**Milestones:**

- **Week 2:** Initial submission of Pytest lab scripts and feedback.
- **Week 3:** Completion of Selenium lab and initial test run results.
- **Week 4:** Full end-to-end tests using Playwright submitted.
- **Week 5:** Acceptance tests with Robot Framework reviewed.

## 4. Lab Approach

**Testing Approach:**
Each lab will follow a structured approach that includes setup, test creation, execution, and analysis.

**General Steps:**

- **Setup Instructions:** Install and configure the testing tool.

- **Test Creation:** Write initial test scripts, starting with simple cases and moving to complex scenarios.

- **Execution:** Run the test scripts and verify results.

- **Analysis:** Review output, identify issues, and ensure tests pass as expected.

- **Documentation:** Record findings, screenshots, and explanations in the provided markdown template.

**Assessment:**

- Each lab will include practical exercises for students to complete, which will be assessed based on accuracy and understanding.

- Students may submit their completed test scripts and output screenshots.
<!- This is at instructor discretion->

## 5. Deliverables

- Individual markdown documents for each lab, with detailed steps and explanations.

- Sample test cases and output validation.

- Screenshots and or code snippets of test runs and results.

- Lab summary reports.

## 6. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Lab Creators:** Responsible for drafting the lab documents, creating test examples, and ensuring labs align with project requirements.

- **Reviewers:** Verify that labs are comprehensive, accurate, and provide clear instructions.

- **Students:** Complete the labs, submit scripts, and participate in any follow-up exercises.

## 7. Lab Details

### Lab 1: Pytest (Unit Testing)

**Objective:** Teach students how to write and run unit tests for individual components.

**Requirements:** Students must write test cases for core functions and execute them using Pytest.

**Expected Outcome:** Students will understand how to validate isolated units of code.

### Lab 2: Selenium (UI Testing)

**Objective:** Guide students in automating UI tests to verify user interactions.

**Requirements:** Create tests for form submissions, button clicks, and navigation.

**Expected Outcome:** Students will be able to automate and validate web page interactions.

### Lab 3: Playwright (End-to-End Testing)

**Objective:** Demonstrate writing comprehensive tests that cover full user journeys.

**Requirements:** Create tests that simulate multi-step interactions.

**Expected Outcome:** Students will understand how to test complex user flows.

### Lab 4: Robot Framework (Acceptance Testing)

**Objective:** Ensure students can write and execute acceptance tests based on user stories.

**Requirements:** Develop tests that check functional and non-functional requirements.

**Expected Outcome:** Students will confirm the application meets specified user needs.

## 8. Test Data Management

**Test Data:**

- Sample tasks, projects, and user credentials will be provided.

- Mock data stored in JSON or other formats as needed.

- Instructions on managing and using test data will be included in each lab.

## 9. Communication and Collaboration

**Weekly Updates:** Progress updates will be shared in MS Teams.

**GitHub:** Labs and reports will be stored in the project repository.

**Reviews and Feedback:** Lab submissions will be reviewed, and feedback provided via GitHub comments and MS Teams discussions.

## 10. Review and Adaptation

The lab plan will be reviewed after each lab cycle to incorporate any necessary changes based on feedback or project updates.

## 11. Approval

This Lab Plan requires review and approval by the project manager and team members: Lacy Fields, Jack Stahl, Shivam Tewari, and Alex Rosa.
